  - GIF support in imagelib
  - pure QRcode library, ideally working with imagelib
    - perhaps inspired by https://github.com/cozmo/jsQR
- [ZIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_%28file_format%29) file utility using [decompress](https://github.com/dinosaure/decompress)
- `diff`/`patch` (TODO research different formats/algorithms, does ocaml-git implement this?)
- graphviz implementation (just the layouting/positioning/coordinates, not necessarily the drawing)
- adding session resumption to [tlsping](https://github.com/cfcs/tlsping)

# *Advanced* (maybe)
- CI tool for determining if an opam package update breaks the API and enforces semantic versioning
  - maybe see Camelus
  - [paper on OPAM + CI](http://www.ocamlpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ocaml2016-opam-builder.pdf)
- erlang-style bit-based pattern matching ppx
- OpenVPN implementation
  - [SoftEther implements it](https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN)
    - [relevent .c file](https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/93d9ade990bd277539138572d7f2bcccfa108407/src/Cedar/Interop_OpenVPN.c) - and the [corresponding .h file](https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/blob/93d9ade990bd277539138572d7f2bcccfa108407/src/Cedar/Interop_OpenVPN.h)
- Multimedia formats;
  - video decoding: [AOMedia Video 1 (aka "AV1")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1) seems to be the coolest, and openest, standard
    - [VP9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP9) is the predecessor, perhaps simpler to implement
    - TODO look into Matroska
  - [FLAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC) decoder
